Don't worry about css/jquery tricks straight away.

First aim for:
  - The individual frame scores to be on the screen
  - There to be a box for entering the current score
  - Final score in the last box
  - Won't let you do anything when the game is over.

- Complete!

Expanded design:
  - Buttons instead of boxes for entering the current score.
  - Score validation in jquery (maybe not necessary if doing the above)
  - Keep track of all scores as you go along by adding the bowl to the page.
  - CSS styling.
